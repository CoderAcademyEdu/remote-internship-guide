Hello Industry Partner,

We are so glad to have you host our eager junior software developers and can&#39;t wait to hear more about their experiences.

As so many of us are navigating this new normal of working virtually in remote teams, we have created this guide based on our case studies from previous virtual or partially remote internships to support you and your development teams.

 You may know some of this information already but we have broken it down to cover the whole process, we also love to build on our guide so if you have any expertise or tips to add please reach out to steph.leahy@coderacademy.edu.au

**PROJECTS**

Consider what type of projects can a junior developer contribute to over the course of four weeks. We recommend steering away from time critical work and focusing on finding a project that can provide the most impactful learning experience.

- **TIP:** Many of our industry partners have chosen projects that have been considered &#39;nice to haves&#39;. As recommended by Gitlab, t[hese are projects that everyone recognizes would benefit the organisation, but do not rise to the level of priority necessary to demand senior staff attention.](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/internship/)

Some of our industry partners choose projects based on their backlog, feature improvement or allocating a separate project away from main roadmap items which can provide our interns with ownership without the pressure of delivery

For example, our junior developers were tasked to perform a review on an existing feature. This project allowed junior developers to work within a small project team to collaborate with different teams (product and design) and even conduct user testing. By the end of the four weeks, our junior developers were able to present their findings back to the development team.

- **TIP:** It&#39;s also important to select projects which are important or notable to a large group. This ensures that many people in the organization are invested in the intern&#39;s success, and it widens the scope of available mentors who are knowledgeable about the project who can step in and help.

**COMMUNICATION**

It&#39;s also important to set clear expectations around communication. If your team has a default mode of communication, make sure interns are well informed about what channels to use and when.

“The biggest thing for me is the concept of don't take the office home to work remotely, not all practices that happen in the office translate to working remotely” - **Emmett Memery, Mallpup**

Embrace remote working with practices that enable better remote working, reduce meetings by finding better ways to communicate, and find interrupted spaces of time; it's an opportunity to work better.
Scheduling time for periodic optional social calls is pretty good to keep a sense of feeling connected and learning about each other. We recommend keeping these more social and away from work conversations if possible.


**CHECKING IN**
In a virtual and remote environment, it can be even more nerve-wracking for junior developers to reach out and ask for help from their managers and mentors. However, a virtual wall can be created if junior developers assume everyone is unreachable or are hesitant to reach out to not cause inconvenience to their mentors and managers. This prolongs the duration of their blockers not being resolved.

 To avoid this, it&#39;s important to schedule time to check in regularly whether it&#39;s over a phone call or through instant messaging to find out what they&#39;re working on, what challenges they are having and how you can best support them.

- **TIP:** We also recommend having a longer one on one catch up at the end of each week to hear how your junior developer is tracking on their goals, to celebrate any wins, resolve any challenges, discuss plans for next week and ask them about what they&#39;ve learned throughout the week.

- **TIP:** If you can manage consistent short catch-ups daily or every second it will help our juniors build good habits, feel supported and build a routine while remote.

- **TIP:** You can even host office hours where your team members have designated times throughout the week where they can pop on to answer questions, do some peer programming or smash out a pomodoro session together for accountability.

- **TIP:** End with a recap and an action plan: Every meeting should end with a clear path forward. It&#39;s easy to misread situations and reactions on video calls, so it&#39;s important to conclude each meeting with a concise recounting of what was discussed and a list of each person&#39;s action items. That way, you give each person a chance to clarify any gray areas and make sure you&#39;re all on the same page.

**INTEGRATION &amp; INVOLVEMENT**

"Top tip when joining a remote team - be proactive about getting to know the members of your team” - **Alexander Cohen, Two Red Kites**
 
Joining a remote team can be a daunting experience and an information overload when starting out. It’s important to take the time to get to know the folks on your team. I recommended setting up an open mic chat room like discord. This will allow you to casually chat between meetings and while working. If it’s appropriate for your organisation, why not play some music? even ask your team mates to take turns suggesting a song! 
 
Being remote doesn’t mean being disconnected. We are still human after all, and connecting with your team mates will improve your job satisfaction, your performance and overall team cohesion. It’s also a great way to build up the relationships with the team members you’ll need to turn to for advise! 

To deliver a sense of connection whilst working remotely, we recommend that you encourage your junior developers to get involved in all aspects of company life such as:

- Attending team meetings
- Attending company all-hands/town halls and huddles
- Attending client meetings
- Attending team bonding activities (e.g We recommend [Jackbox](https://www.jackboxgames.com/)&amp;[Bunch](https://bunch.live/) to get the team together for group chats and games)


Even if your junior developer is unable to contribute directly, they&#39;ll still benefit from attending these sessions as they&#39;ll be able to have a better understanding of how different roles within the organisation contribute to the wider business goals. It also helps your junior developers feel part of the team and it will also help your existing development team recognize the abilities of each junior developer.

**PREBOARDING**
 Getting ready for your intern&#39;s upcoming arrival by ensuring you&#39;ve ticked off all the items below:

- Ensure you have defined the projects that they will be working on or the work that needs to be done during the four weeks that they are with you

- Revisit your Agile processes (e.g Stand ups, Planning &amp; Retros) to ensure they work for a remote work environment
- Consider all the systems (e.g software, access to files, VPN access) your interns will need access to and all the tools you&#39;ll need to communicate effectively
- Share your tips on best practices for remote work with your intern before they start (for example, if they need immediate help they can ping you on slack etc)
- Ensure your team knows what is expected of them as mentors. During the duration of the internship, they will be called upon to provide feedback, demonstrate best practices and help onboard our junior developers as they become familiar with your business, processes and tools.
- Send through any helpful resources you have on your products or your tech stack prior to their first day. Our junior developers are all eager learners and would value the opportunity to become familiar with your products and tech stack before they start
- Prepare a checklist of things you would like your junior developers to complete each week of the internship. This will be helpful to measure progress and refer to in your one on one check ins.

Getting started: The First Day

If possible, if you are located in the same city, it can be incredibly helpful to meet face to face to run through the tools. This does not have to be the whole team, a one person touch point is just as helpful.
